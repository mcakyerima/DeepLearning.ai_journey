# LangChain for LLM Application Development

Welcome to the "LangChain for LLM Application Development" course directory. This course will introduce you to LangChain and how to leverage it for developing applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). Below, you'll find an overview of the course, prerequisites, and links to course materials.

## Overview

This course is designed to provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to use LangChain effectively for developing applications that utilize Large Language Models. You'll learn how to call LLMs into new environments, utilize memories, chains, and agents, and take on new and complex tasks with LangChain.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, it's recommended to have a basic understanding of Python programming.
